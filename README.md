task 3 for ORISION TECHNOLOGY Internship 

To-Do List & Calendar App
A simple and intuitive To-Do List and Calendar application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app enables users to manage regular tasks and date-specific tasks, making it easy to stay organized and on top of their daily schedules.

Features
Regular To-Do List:

Add tasks and mark them as completed or pending.
Remove tasks when they are no longer needed.
Calendar To-Do List:

Add tasks that are specific to certain dates.
View tasks for any given date on the calendar.
Organize tasks by date and manage them efficiently.
Local Storage:

All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so your data persists across page reloads.
Responsive Design:

The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
